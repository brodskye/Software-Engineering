Random Testing Quiz
10/22/17
I started off this quiz by looking at Piazza for some more clarification on how exactly the quiz was supposed to be implemented because it would change how I approached what I did.  Once I found out that we did not need to use every character in the ascii character set I thought the smartest approach would be to remove any character from the set of randomly generated characters that was not a character I was looking for.  I narrowed down my string for the char c to "[({ ax})]" because it was the only characters that I needed in order to get the output that I was looking for.  I then randomly chose one of the characters in that list and assigned it to my rand_char which I returned from my function and ended up being the char c value.  I did the same thing with my char *s just with the chars "rest", the way I implemented this function was a bit different then before, first of all I had to allocate memory to store the string in order for it to not seg fault.  Next I created another list of random chars just as I stated before and randomly assigned a char to one of the chars in the list.  Once I had that working I ran a for loop that went for 5 iterations so because that is how long the string "reset" is, inside of the for loopI assigned each peice of my string dependent on where it is to the randomly selected char for that loop of the for loop, I then set the 6th element in my string to a null terminator.  Once I completed all of this I ran my function and it worked properly.  This same implementation would work with every ASCII character in the randomly selected chars but it would take significantly longer to find the string we are looking for, and pretty much impossible to find it in under 5 minutes.
